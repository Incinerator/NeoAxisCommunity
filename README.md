Welcome to the NeoAxis Community Project!
================
This contains community improvements to NeoAxis 3D Game Engine.


Getting Started
================
If your just looking to use the community improvements, then locate the newest stable tag. Versions are labeled such that the NeoAxis version number is immediately followed by the community version number. This means that in `v2.0.4.1`, the NeoAxis version is `2.0.4`, and the community version number is `1`.


Contributing
================
To contribute, first create your own fork, you'll need this in order to submit a pull request. Then you'll need to add your modifications to an appropriately named branch, making sure to use the master branch as the base. Once your modifications are complete and fully functional, submit a pull request to be reviewed, and once it's been reviewed and accepted, we'll add it to the master branch, and it will be included in the next stable release of the community edition.
